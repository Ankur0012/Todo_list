A to-do list is a simple yet effective organizational tool used to keep track of tasks, assignments, or activities that need to be completed within a certain timeframe. It provides users with a centralized platform to list down their tasks, helping them prioritize and manage their time more efficiently.

The basic functionalities of a to-do list typically include:

Adding Tasks: Users can input tasks into the list, usually by typing them into a designated input field and pressing an "Add" button. This action adds the task to the list, making it visible for the user to see and manage.

Deleting Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are completed or are no longer relevant. This is often done by selecting the task from the list and pressing a "Delete" button or using a similar method to indicate the task for removal.

These functions form the core features of a to-do list, providing users with the ability to add new tasks as they come up and remove tasks as they are completed or become unnecessary. This simplicity and ease of use make to-do lists a popular choice for organizing daily activities, managing projects, and improving productivity.
